and roof solar absorptance of 0.6 were assumed. The equivalence of the one-zone model versus the two- zone base case was verified with sensitivity tests using BLAST and SERIRES/SUNCODE. However, model the attic as a separate zone if your software allows it.

2.2.2 Vented Crawl Space
No attempt was made to describe the vented crawl space as a separate zone. To simulate a vented crawl space, HERS BESTEST only requires the floor to have an exterior film coefficient for "rough" surface texture and zero windspeed (in addition to the floor materials and interior film coefficient). Consistent with ASHRAE Handbook 1993 Fundamentals, vented crawl space air temperature is assumed to equal outdoor air temperature.

2.2.3 Windows
A great deal of information about the window properties has been provided so that equivalent input for windows will be possible for many programs. The basic properties of the single-pane window, including shading coefficient, solar heat gain coefficient, and thermal resistance, are provided in Table 2-3. Additional information can be found in Figure 2-8, Table 2-6, and Tables 2-12 through 2-14. This information is drawn primarily from the WINDOW 4.1 (WINDOW 4.1, 1994) software for developing detailed glazing properties. For programs that need transmittance or reflectance at other angles of incidence, interpolate between the values of Table 2-14. Where other unspecified data are needed, then values consistent with those quoted will have to be calculated.
For the base case, total glass and frame areas for each wall can be combined into a single large area for that wall. For later cases where shading is used, the specific window geometry will need to be modeled as closely as possible.

2.2.4 Interior Walls
The interior walls within the conditioned zone have been included for the purpose of modeling the effect of their mass. They are not intended to divide the conditioned zone into separately controlled zones. The importance of modeling interior wall mass will be more evident in Tier 2 tests when passive solar cases are added to HERS BESTEST.

2.2.5 Infiltration
Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Las Vegas, Nevada, are at 6145 ft. and 2178 ff. altitude Tespectively, so the density of air is Jess than that at sea-level for both locations. If your program does not use barometric pressure from the weather data, or otherwise automatically corrects for the change in air density caused by altitude, then adjust the specified infiltration rates (to yield mass flows equivalent to what would occur at the specified altitude) as shown in Table 2-4. Only use the attic infiltration rate if your software allows that input. Attic infiltration is based on the Cooling and Heating Load Calculation Manual, (McQuiston and Spitler, P. 4.12) for typical ventilation by natural effects. If you need more information about altitude effects on infiltration, see Appendix B.

2.2.6 Internal Loads
These are non-HVAC related internally generated loads from equipment, lights, people, animals, etc. An hourly internal load schedule for the conditioned zone is specified in Table 2-11. There are no internal loads in the attic. This schedule disaggregates sensible and latent loads. If your software does not analyze latent loads, then leave them out and use only the sensible portion of the internal loads. Aggregate sensible loads are 70% radiative and 30% convective.
Because internal loads are given only for their effect on heating and cooling load, the equipment fuel type and efficiency associated with generating these loads do not matter.

2.2.7 Combined Radiative and Convective Surface Coefficients
Combined surface coefficients are denoted in various section drawings throughout Volume 1 as "Interior Film" and "Exterior Film" (e.g., see Figures 2-4 through 2-7). If your program uses combined surface coefficients, then use the information given in Table 2-4 (this information is also included with the detailed material descriptions of Tables 2-6 through 2-10). Because the heating season average windspeed for Colorado Springs, Colorado, is nearly equal to the cooling season average windspeed for Las Vegas, Nevada, the listed exterior surface coefficients apply to both climates.
If your program does not allow variation of combined surface coefficients or if your program automatically calculates interior and exterior surface convection and radiation in greater detail, then you may ignore this information. See Appendices C and D if you need more information on surface coefficients.

2.2.8 Surface Radiative Properties
Surface radiative properties are given in Table 2-4. These properties apply to all opaque exterior and interior building surfaces; they are roughly equivalent to medium color paint or a light color roof.

2.2.9 Interior Solar Distribution
Interior solar distribution is the fraction of transmitted solar radiation incident on specific surfaces in a room. This effect can be significant in passive solar applications. If your program does not calculate this effect internally, then use the interior solar fractions from Table 2-5. The calculation of transmitted solar radiation reflected back out through windows (cavity albedo) is presented in Appendix E. If your program does not allow for variations of interior solar distribution, then disregard.

2.2.10 Mechanical System
For the base building, obtain only pure load outputs (i.e., assume all equipment including ducts is 100% efficient). The thermostat settings and equipment descriptions below are sufficient for this purpose. This mechanical system only applies to the conditioned zone; it does not apply to the unconditioned attic. Assume the following:

* 100% Convective Air System 
* The thermostat senses only the air temperature 
* The thermostat is of the nonproportional type.

2.2.10.1 Thermostat Control Strategies
Annual thermostat control settings are shown below. Because monthly reference results for an entire year are provided in Volume 2, Section 3, your heating and cooling seasons may be for the entire year or some other reasonable length as designated by your tool. Instructions for using monthly reference results are also provided in Volume 2, Section 3.
For Colorado Springs, Colorado (heating only) cases: 
	HEAT = ON IF TEMP < 68°F; COOL = OFF.
For Las Vegas, Nevada (cooling only) cases: 
	COOL = ON IF TEMP > 78°F; HEAT = OFF.
	
The thermostat is nonproportional in the sense that when the air temperature exceeds the thermostat cooling set-point, the heat extraction rate is assumed to equal the maximum capacity of the cooling equipment. Likewise, when the air temperature drops below the thermostat heating set-point, the heat addition rate equals the maximum capacity of the heating equipment. A proportional thermostat model can be made to approximate a nonproportional thermostat model by setting a very small throttling range (the minimum allowed by your program).

2.2.10.2 Equipment Characteristics

HEATING CAPACITY = 3413 MBtwh (effectively infinite). 
EFFECTIVE EFFICIENCY = 100%.

COOLING CAPACITY = 3413 MBtwh (effectively infinite). 
EFFECTIVE EFFICIENCY = 100%.

WASTE HEAT FROM FAN = 0.

The 3413 MBtu/h requirement comes from the english equivalent of 1 MW. If your software does not allow this much capacity, then use the largest system that your software will allow.

## The starting of Figure 2-2
The image is a detailed floor plan labeled "Case L100A" with specific measurements and placements of structural elements such as windows and doors. Here’s the detailed analysis based on the labeled data:
- **Overall Layout**: The layout is rectangular, and oriented with the north direction indicated at the top of the image. The external measurements of the layout are approximately 57 feet in width and 27 feet 8 inches in depth.
- **Rooms and Spaces**: The image does not explicitly delineate individual rooms, but the placement of doors and windows suggests partitioned spaces or potential rooms.
- **Windows**: Labeled with a "W", these are 3 feet wide by 5 feet high. They are found uniformly distributed along the external walls of the layout. 
- **Doors**: Identified with a "D", and are solid-core wood doors measuring 3 feet wide by 6 feet 8 inches high. There are two doors shown on the plan; their locations are specified with measurements from nearby structural elements.
- **Measurement Notations**: The plan uses feet-and-inch notation to specify the distance between architectural elements such as from corner to window or window to door. For instance, starting from the left of the plan:
  - There are series of windows and doors punctuated by specific measurements like 6’-0” between windows, or 2’-0” between a window and a door.
- **Document Identification**: At the lower right corner, there's a code "CD0-AH06-A0327301" which likely serves as an identification or reference code for this floor plan within a larger document or architectural project.
Legend: W = Window (3’ wide x 5’ high)
D = Solid-core wood door (3’ wide x 6’8” high)

## The starting of Figure 2-5
From the top to the bottom of the diagram:
1. **Interior Film**: This serves as the interior finish or barrier layer between the indoor living space and the floor structure.
2. **Carpet with Pad (R-2.08)**: Represents the carpet and its padding, with a mentioned R-value of 2.08, indicating its thermal resistance.
3. **Plywood (3/4")**: This 3/4 inch thick plywood acts as the main structural element of the flooring.
4. **Fiberglass Batt (R-11)**: Fiberglass insulation with an R-value of 11, used for thermal insulation between the floor joists.
5. **Exterior Film (Still Air)**: Below the insulation, this film likely acts as a moisture barrier, facing the crawl space.
6. **Joists**: The diagram shows floor joists labeled as "2 x 8, 16" o.c." which means that each joist is 2 inches by 8 inches in cross-section and placed with a center-to-center spacing of 16 inches.

Framed Section and Insulated Section over the joists indicate different construction or treatment areas of the floor structure, particularly pointing to where framing and insulation are located.
Arrow symbols in the crawl space Denote that the crawl space is vented, helping ventilate the space to prevent moisture accumulation.

## The starting of Figure 2-6
The image illustrates a detailed architectural cross-section view of a ceiling/attic/roof construction commonly found in residential buildings, specifically marked as "Case L100A." The diagram is divided into two main sections showing different components:

1. **Roof Section:**
   - On the topmost layer, an **Exterior Film** is shown, which likely acts as a weather barrier.
   - Beneath the exterior film are **Shingles**, which serve as the primary protective and water-proof layer.
   - Below the shingles is a **Plywood Sheathing** layer, indicated as being 1/2" thick. This serves as the structural base for the shingles.
   - Below the plywood, the space is identified as **Attic Air**, implying a ventilated attic space.

2. **Ceiling Section:**
   - The ceiling starts with **2x6** framing members, which are spaced 24 inches on center. These are typical dimensions for roof or ceiling joists in residential construction.
   - Within the spaces between the framing, **Fiberglass Batt** insulation is installed, with an R-value of 19. This type of insulation is common for reducing heat transfer and increasing energy efficiency.
   - Below the fiberglass batts, there is a **Plasterboard** depicted as being 1/2" thick. This typically forms the ceiling surface of the room below.
   - An **Interior Film** is shown directly beneath the plasterboard, which might serve as a vapor barrier to prevent moisture ingress from the living spaces into the insulation.

Additional aspects of the diagram:
   - The roofing section's angle and overlapping layers suggest a sloped roof design.
   - The diagram includes two separate labels for sections – one as "Framed Section" and another as "Insulated Section," indicating the designated areas for structural framing and thermal insulation respectively.

This simplistic yet thorough blueprint is useful in understanding the layer-by-layer assembly of a standard residential roof and ceiling construction.

2.2.11 Case L100A: Supplementary Tables
The following data were used for generating reference results. The previous figures and tables summarized, and are based on, the data presented in this section. We expect that many HERS tools will not be able to directly input much of the data in this section (e.g., material densities, specific heats, detailed window optical properties, interior solar fractions, surface coefficients, etc.). However, if your models are capable of receiving this level of detail, then you must use these tables where possible.

Note 1: Solar energy transmitted through windows is assumed as distributed to interior opaque surfaces in proportion to their areas. Only the radiation not directly absorbed by lightweight furnishings (assumed to exist only for the purpose of calculating inside solar fraction) or lost back out through windows is distributed to interior opaque surfaces.
Note 2: Net wall area is gross wal] area less the rough opening areas of the windows and door. Insulated and framed exterior wall sections are defined in Figure 2-4. ASHRAE framed area fraction of 0.25 is assumed for 2x4 16" O.C. construction.
Note 3: Width is the total length of all interior walls. Framed wall area is assumed to be 10% of gross wall area for 2x4 16" O.C. framing. Only one side of the wall is considered for listed area. This area is multiplied by 2 for determining solar fractions. Solar fractions shown are for just one side of the interior wall.
Note 4: Insulated and framed floor and ceiling sections are defined in Figures 2-5 and 2-6 respectively. ASHRAE roof/ceiling framing area fraction of 0.1 applied to both ceiling and floor.
Note 5: The multiplier accounts for both the northward and southward sloped portions of the roof deck.
