The image is a detailed floor plan labeled "Case L100A" with specific measurements and placements of structural elements such as windows and doors. Here’s the detailed analysis based on the labeled data:

- **Overall Layout**: The layout is rectangular, and oriented with the north direction indicated at the top of the image. The external measurements of the layout are approximately 57 feet in width and 29 feet 8 inches in depth.

- **Rooms and Spaces**: The image does not explicitly delineate individual rooms, but the placement of doors and windows suggests partitioned spaces or potential rooms.

- **Windows**: Labeled with a "W", these are 3 feet wide by 5 feet high. They are found uniformly distributed along the external walls of the layout. Their exact positions are marked with measurements from adjacent windows or the edges of the walls.

- **Doors**: Identified with a "D", and are solid-core wood doors measuring 3 feet wide by 6 feet 8 inches high. There are two doors shown on the plan; their locations are specified with measurements from nearby structural elements.

- **Measurement Notations**: The plan uses feet-and-inch notation to specify the distance between architectural elements such as from corner to window or window to door. For instance, starting from the left of the plan:
  - There are series of windows and doors punctuated by specific measurements like 6’-0” between windows, or 2’-0” between a window and a door.

- **Legend and References**: At the bottom of the image, a legend explains the symbols used (W for Windows and D for Doors). Additionally, it specifies to see "Figure 2-8" for windows, suggesting there are additional documents or images related to this plan.

- **Other Markings and Notations**: There are additional small notational details like the arrows showing specific dimensions across spaces between windows and doors, and individual dimensions labeling the thickness of the external walls.

- **Document Identification**: At the lower right corner, there's a code "CD0-AH06-A0327301" which likely serves as an identification or reference code for this floor plan within a larger document or architectural project.

This plan serves as a technical reference for constructing or remodeling a building, with precise measurements crucial for builders and contractors. The absence of detail about internal partitions besides doors and windows suggests that the focus is on the shell or exterior framework of the structure.

Figure 2-2. Floor plan—Case L100A


This image depicts an architectural elevation drawing labeled as "Figure 2-3. East side elevation—Case L100A." The drawing represents the east side face of a building highlighted through various dimensions and annotations giving specifics about its construction and design.


Key elements noted in the drawing:

1. **Roof and Elevation**:
   - There is a slanted roof with a pitch indicated as 4:12.
   - The highest point on the roof measures 13 feet and 6 inches from the peak to the eave.

2. **Measurements**:
   - The building height from the base to the eaves is shown as 8 feet and 0 inches.
   - The total length of the structure from left to right spans 27 feet.
   - The vertical measurement in the center of the wall, from the top of the wall up to the lowest point of the roof, is shown as 18 feet and 43 inches.
   - The separation between the eave and the peak along the slanted line (apparently the main roof inclination) is noted as 14 feet and 23 inches.

3. **Windows**:
   - There are two windows represented, both aligned vertically.
   - Each window is labeled with a height separation of 1 foot and 0 inches in the area between them, and each window has essentially similar designs, noted with respective measurements adjacent.
   - According to the note beneath the elevation, "All windows located vertically as shown here."

The drawing uses simple lines and clean labels for clarity. No additional text or design details are provided beyond the structural and dimensional annotations. The presence of a reference code “CD-H06-A0372702” possibly identifies the document or project file reference.

The image is a technical drawing titled "Figure 2-4. Exterior wall plan section—Case L100A". It depicts a cross-sectional view of an exterior wall, divided into two main sections: the "Insulated Section" and the "Framed Section". The drawing provides a detailed representation of the different layers and components that make up this portion of the wall.

**From the interior to the exterior, the layers are as follows:**

1. **Interior Film**: This is the innermost layer displayed in the diagram, likely a vapor barrier or similar protective film.
   
2. **Plasterboard (1/2 inch)**: Next to the interior film, there is a half-inch thick plasterboard, commonly used as an interior wall covering.

3. **Fiberglass Batt (R-11)**: Beside the plasterboard is an R-11 fiberglass batt insulation, noted for its thermal resistance. The thickness isn't specified, but it fills the space between the structural framing.

4. **2 x 4, 16" o.c.**: This indicates the framing of the wall consisting of 2x4 inch lumber spaced 16 inches on center. This is the structural component of the wall.

5. **Fiberboard Sheathing (1/2 inch)**: Outside the framing, there is half-inch thick fiberboard sheathing that helps in providing a flat surface and adds rigidity to the structure.

6. **Hardboard Siding (7/16 inch)**: This is the exterior sheathing component, 7/16 inch thick, likely providing weather protection and aesthetic appeal.

7. **Exterior Film**: The outermost layer that might be another protective film specifically for exterior use against moisture and elements.

**Other Features:**
- Arrows point within certain layers (like the plasterboard and fiberglass batt), possibly indicating the direction or path used for certain utility installations or additional reinforcements within the layers.
- The wall diagram is split into two sections. The left side says "Insulated Section" emphasizing the presence and continuity of insulation through this portion, whereas the right side states "Framed Section," focusing on the structural framework.

This cross-sectional view provides insights into the construction and materials used for a robust, insulated exterior wall, crucial for understanding thermal insulation properties and structural integrity in building architecture.

Figure 2-4. Exterior wall plan section—Case L100A

The image provided is a technical drawing labeled “Figure 2-5. Floor above vented crawl space, section—Case L100A”. This is a cross-sectional diagram that details the construction and materials used in building the floor above a vented crawl space.

From the top to the bottom of the diagram:
1. **Interior Film**: This serves as the interior finish or barrier layer between the indoor living space and the floor structure.
2. **Carpet with Pad (R-2.08)**: Represents the carpet and its padding, with a mentioned R-value of 2.08, indicating its thermal resistance.
3. **Plywood (3/4")**: This 3/4 inch thick plywood acts as the main structural element of the flooring.
4. **Fiberglass Batt (R-11)**: Fiberglass insulation with an R-value of 11, used for thermal insulation between the floor joists.
5. **Exterior Film (Still Air)**: Below the insulation, this film likely acts as a moisture barrier, facing the crawl space.
6. **Joists**: The diagram shows floor joists labeled as "2 x 8, 16" o.c." which means that each joist is 2 inches by 8 inches in cross-section and placed with a center-to-center spacing of 16 inches.

Framed Section and Insulated Section over the joists indicate different construction or treatment areas of the floor structure, particularly pointing to where framing and insulation are located.
Arrow symbols in the crawl space Denote that the crawl space is vented, helping ventilate the space to prevent moisture accumulation.

This diagram is typical in architectural and construction planning to specify material choices, layout, and to ensure that construction meets building codes especially regarding insulation and ventilation which are critical for energy efficiency and moisture control.

Figure 2-5. Floor above vented crawl space, section—Case L100A

The image illustrates a detailed architectural cross-section view of a ceiling/attic/roof construction commonly found in residential buildings, specifically marked as "Case L100A." The diagram is divided into two main sections showing different components:

1. **Roof Section:**
   - On the topmost layer, an **Exterior Film** is shown, which likely acts as a weather barrier.
   - Beneath the exterior film are **Shingles**, which serve as the primary protective and water-proof layer.
   - Below the shingles is a **Plywood Sheathing** layer, indicated as being 1/2" thick. This serves as the structural base for the shingles.
   - Below the plywood, the space is identified as **Attic Air**, implying a ventilated attic space.

2. **Ceiling Section:**
   - The ceiling starts with **2x6** framing members, which are spaced 24 inches on center. These are typical dimensions for roof or ceiling joists in residential construction.
   - Within the spaces between the framing, **Fiberglass Batt** insulation is installed, with an R-value of 19. This type of insulation is common for reducing heat transfer and increasing energy efficiency.
   - Below the fiberglass batts, there is a **Plasterboard** depicted as being 1/2" thick. This typically forms the ceiling surface of the room below.
   - An **Interior Film** is shown directly beneath the plasterboard, which might serve as a vapor barrier to prevent moisture ingress from the living spaces into the insulation.

Additional aspects of the diagram:
   - The roofing section's angle and overlapping layers suggest a sloped roof design.
   - The diagram includes two separate labels for sections – one as "Framed Section" and another as "Insulated Section," indicating the designated areas for structural framing and thermal insulation respectively.

This simplistic yet thorough blueprint is useful in understanding the layer-by-layer assembly of a standard residential roof and ceiling construction.

Figure 2-6. Ceiling/attic/roof section-Case 

The image depicts a detailed sectional diagram of an interior wall. The section is labeled as "Figure 2-7. Interior wall plan section—Case L100A". It illustrates various components of the wall construction from one side to another. Here is a breakdown of each part as shown in the diagram:

1. **Interior Film**: This is the topmost layer on the visible side of the diagram. It’s a thin layer, possibly a type of vapor barrier or decorative surface.

2. **Plasterboard (1/2")**: Below the interior film is a half-inch thick plasterboard, commonly used as a finishing surface for walls in construction. It provides a smooth, paintable surface.

3. **Air Gap**: Situated between the two plasterboard panels, there appears to be a small air gap. This gap could be functional for insulation or soundproofing purposes.

4. **2 x 4, 16" o.c.**: Representing the structural framework of the wall, these are 2x4 inch lumber pieces spaced 16 inches on center (o.c.). These are typical measurements used for the studs in wall construction, providing support for the attached wall materials and overall structural integrity.

5. **Another Plasterboard (1/2")**: Like the front side, there’s another half-inch thick plasterboard panel on the other side, completing the basic wall sandwich structure.

This image doesn’t show any additional insulation material between the studs, which might be included depending on the wall’s requirements for temperature control or additional soundproofing. The diagram appears technical, likely part of a construction manual or educational resource, used for teaching or professional reference in building interiors.
