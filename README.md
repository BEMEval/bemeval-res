### 📘 Overview
**BEMEval-Res** is the residential benchmark of the open-source **BEMEval** framework — a standardized dataset and evaluation suite for testing large language models (LLMs) on **building energy modeling (BEM)** tasks.

The benchmark focuses on translating *unstructured building descriptions* into *structured energy modeling schemas*, enabling consistent and reproducible evaluation of AI models in the BEM domain.

### 🧩 Key Features
- **Multiple Schemas** – Includes both **industry** and **research** schemas:
  - [HPXML](https://hpxml.nrel.gov/) – consensus residential schema for home energy modeling
  - **EPC-Schema** – customized normative schema based on ISO/CEN 13790 energy performance methods
- **Representative Building Cases** – curated building descriptions from:
  - HERS L100 test case
  - NIST NZERTF (single-family)
  - NREL iUnit (apartment/multifamily)
- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Key–Value Overlap Rate (KVOR)
